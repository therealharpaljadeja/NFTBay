# NFTBay - NFT Marketplace on Reef Blockchain.

## Inspiration
- Psuedo-permissionless marketplaces like Opensea, lets users create NFTs but these NFTs are operated by the Opensea StoreFront contract. 
- Why not give every user their own NFT collection to mint NFTs from?
- Insider trading for upcoming featured drops. Trustless?

## What it does
- NFTBay is an NFT Marketplace built on Reef Blockchain.
- NFTBay lets you create, sell and buy NFTs.

## How I built it
- NFTBay is built using ReactJS Frontend and Reef Blockchain Smart Contracts as Backend. I used Hardhat as a testing and development environment.

## Accomplishments I am proud of
- NFTBay is a truly **trustless** and **permissionless** Marketplace. 100% ownership and no need of approaching any authority to get your NFTs listed.

## What's next for NFTBay
- NFTBay plans to let creators to do **permissionless token launch**. 
- NFTBay plans to let creators spin up their own **token governed DAO's**
- NFTBay plans to let creators create **Multi-Royalty** (Collaboration b/w creators / brands) based NFTs.
